                The Nikon Df features exceptional metering and onboard intelligence, freeing you to focus on the
                composition of your shots and, most importantly, the moment that's taking place.
            </p>
            <p>
                Nikon's outstanding Scene Recognition System analyzes your shooting situation, compares it to an onboard
                database of
                thousands of scenes and automatically determines the most appropriate exposure, white balance and
                autofocus settings as well as i-TTL flash exposure when using a Nikon Speedlight.
            </p>
            <p>
                Built-in HDR automatically combines two photos into one highly dynamic image, and new subject-based
                Active D-Lighting automatically brightens shadowy areas on your subjects—great for portraits.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Nikon Df's easy to use Picture Controls let you alter your color palette and add a personal touch
                with six settings available; Standard, Neutral, Vivid, Monochrome, Portrait and Landscape—customize the
                look and feel of your photos.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Nikon Df is compatible with so many past and present NIKKOR lenses, it's easy to expand your
                capabilities and creativity over time by growing your own collection.

                moon, but the craters, peaks and valleys of its surface. Imagine being able to view the International
                Space Station in flight, even the rings of Saturn—not with a telescope, but with a one-of-a-kind Nikon
                camera.
